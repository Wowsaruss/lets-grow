# LetsGrow

LetsGrow is being built as a way for simple minded humans (like me) to gain local knowledge about gardening, by learning from other gardeners successes and failures. Getting into gardening is super overwhelming and many times people just people give up before they ever reach the exciting stuff. Hopefully this can be a tool to help people grow a greener thumb.
